      <h5>SMA Trading Algorithm</h5>
      <p>
        The Simple Moving Average (SMA) is a widely used technical analysis tool in trading.
        It helps traders identify trends and generate buy or sell signals based on price movements.
        The SMA calculates the average price of an asset over a specific period of time, usually the closing prices.
      </p>
      <p>
        To calculate the SMA, you sum up the closing prices for the chosen period and divide it by the number of periods.
        The resulting value represents the SMA for that particular point in time.
        By plotting the SMA on a chart, you can visualize the average price over time and analyze its relationship with the current price.
      </p>
      <p>
        Traders often use the crossover of the price and the SMA as a signal for potential trading opportunities.
        When the price crosses above the SMA, it could indicate a bullish signal, suggesting it's a good time to buy.
        Conversely, when the price crosses below the SMA, it could indicate a bearish signal, suggesting it's a good time to sell.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's important to note that the SMA is a lagging indicator, meaning it reacts slower to price changes compared to other technical indicators.
        Traders usually combine SMA with other indicators and analysis techniques to make informed trading decisions.
