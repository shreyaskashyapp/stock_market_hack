      <h2>How Does the Stock Market Work?</h2>
      <p>
        The stock market is a place where individuals and institutions can buy and sell shares of publicly traded companies. It provides a platform for investors to participate in the ownership and growth of businesses.
      </p>
      <h3>Stocks</h3>
      <p>
        Stocks, also known as shares or equities, represent ownership in a company. When you buy shares of a company's stock, you become a partial owner of that company. Stocks are traded on stock exchanges, such as the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) or NASDAQ.
      </p>
      <h3>Stock Price</h3>
      <p>
        The price of a stock is determined by supply and demand. If more people want to buy a stock than sell it, the price generally goes up. Conversely, if more people want to sell a stock than buy it, the price usually goes down. Various factors, such as a company's financial performance, industry trends, and economic conditions, can influence stock prices.
      </p>
      <h3>Stock Exchanges</h3>
      <p>
        Stock exchanges are centralized marketplaces where buyers and sellers come together to trade stocks. They provide the infrastructure, rules, and regulations necessary for orderly trading. In addition to facilitating stock transactions, exchanges provide public access to stock prices, trading volumes, and other market-related information.
      </p>
      <h3>Investing and Trading</h3>
      <p>
        There are two primary approaches to participate in the stock market: investing and trading.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Investing:</strong> Investors aim to buy stocks of fundamentally strong companies with the intention of holding them for the long term. They focus on factors such as a company's financial health, growth prospects, and industry position. Investors may generate returns through dividends (share of profits distributed by the company) and capital appreciation (increase in stock price over time).
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Trading:</strong> Traders take a more short-term approach, buying and selling stocks with the goal of profiting from short-term price fluctuations. They rely on technical analysis, charts, and market trends to make trading decisions. Trading can be more speculative and requires active monitoring of the markets.
      </p>
      <h3>Risk and Rewards</h3>
      <p>
        Investing in the stock market offers potential rewards but also involves risks. Stocks can be volatile, and their prices can fluctuate significantly in response to various factors. It's important to diversify your investments, conduct research, and understand the risks associated with investing. It's also advisable to consult with a financial advisor before making investment decisions.
